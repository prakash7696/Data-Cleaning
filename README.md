## Handling-Missing-Values
        Importing Pandas and Numpy Modules
        How many missing data points do we have
        Figure out why the data is missing
        Drop missing values
        Filling in missing values automatically
# Scaling and Normalization
## Get our environment set up

# Parsing Dates
# Character Encodings

# Inconsistent Data Entry
        Do some preliminary text pre-processing
        We'll begin by taking a quick look at the first few rows of the data
## Use fuzzy matching to correct inconsistent data entry
